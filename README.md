# SentimentAnalyzer

Technologies used: **Python, Tweepy (TwitterAPI library), Natural Language Toolkit Library, Matplotlib** 

Twitter sentiment analyzer I made for a demo for an internship. Requires a couple files to run (use python main.py): 

profanity.json - a list of words to filter from results (I had to use the generated wordcloud on a presentation): {"words":[]}

secrets.json - information needed to access twitter api: {
    "api_key": "",
    "api_secret": "",
    "bearer_token": "",
    "access_token": "",
    "access_secret": ""
}
